## Inspiration



## What it does

EcoFriend is a social network focused on encouraging people to care for the environment and proof that they did so. Users can earn points by receiving likes on their posts of eco-friendly acts that they did. The points in turn rank them on leaderboards.

## Challenges we ran into

Believe it or not, setting up the Flutter, Dart, and Android SDKs was an obstacle. After that, we had trouble with fetching data from the Twitter API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We learned Flutter in less than a day and made multiple pages for our application.
